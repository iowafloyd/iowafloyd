- 👋 Hi, I’m @iowafloyd
- 👀 I’m interested in pivoting from a ~15 year career in Engineering to become a data engineer, developer or data scientist.
- 💞️ I've been coding since I was around 12 years old, when I learned to reprogram my Thrustmaster FLCS using QBASIC.
- (does anyone else remember playing Strike Commander, or Wing Commander, or ATF: Advanced Tactical Fighters?)
- Then I learned HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript to build my own interactive poetry site on Geocities (back in the before-times).
- I learned some C++ in a high school elective, but didn't have a use-case to continue using it.
- Finally, I taught myself Python for data science (Numpy, Pandas, some TensorFlow and Pytorch) for a personal data science project.
- That started in 2018 and is ongoing.
- Oh yeah, and VBA for streamlining Excel calculations/workflows at work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, ReactJS, and more PyTorch/TensorFlow
- 📫 You can reach me at iowafloyd@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I love amphibians. Turtles, frogs, snails, worms, etc.!
