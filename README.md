- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iowafloyd
- Iâ€™m interested in pivoting from a ~15 year career in Engineering to become a data engineer, developer or data scientist.
- I've been coding since I was around 12 years old, when I learned to reprogram my Thrustmaster FLCS using QBASIC.
- Then I learned HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript to build a personal website circa 1998.
- I learned some C++ in a high school elective, but didn't have a need for it after that.
- Excel + VBA is my daily driver for work.
- Though since ~2019 I've been using Python/Jupyter/TF for a personal data science project .
- ðŸŒ± In my spare time now Iâ€™m learning SQL, and a bit more JS.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at iowafloyd@gmail.com
